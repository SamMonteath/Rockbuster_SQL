Using Sub Queries

#1. Find the average amount paid by the Top 5 Customers

SELECT A. customer_id,
A. first_name,
A.last_name,
C. city,
D. country,
SUM(F.amount) AS total_spend
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN rental E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
INNER JOIN payment F ON E.rental_id = F.rental_id
WHERE city = 'Aurora' OR city = 'Acua' OR city = 'Citrus Heights' OR city ='Iwaki' OR city = 'Ambattur' OR city = 'Shanwei' OR city = 'So Leopoldo' OR city = 'Teboksary' OR city = 'Tianjin' OR city = 'Cianjur'
GROUP BY A. customer_id, A. first_name, A.last_name, C. city, D. country
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 5)
AS total_amount_paid

#2. Write an outer statement to calculate the average amount paid

SELECT AVG(total_spend) AS average
FROM
(
SELECT A. customer_id,
A. first_name,
A.last_name,
C. city,
D. country,
SUM(F.amount) AS total_spend
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN rental E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
INNER JOIN payment F ON E.rental_id = F.rental_id
WHERE city = 'Aurora' OR city = 'Acua' OR city = 'Citrus Heights' OR city ='Iwaki' OR city = 'Ambattur' OR city = 'Shanwei' OR city = 'So Leopoldo' OR city = 'Teboksary' OR city = 'Tianjin' OR city = 'Cianjur'
GROUP BY A. customer_id, A. first_name, A.last_name, C. city, D. country
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 5)

#3. Find out how many of the top 5 customers you identified in step 1 are based within each country.

SELECT 
    D.country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT T.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT A.customer_id, D.country
    FROM customer A
    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    INNER JOIN rental E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
    INNER JOIN payment F ON E.rental_id = F.rental_id
    WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 
                   'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
    GROUP BY A.customer_id, D.country
    ORDER BY SUM(F.amount) DESC
    LIMIT 5
) AS T ON A.customer_id = T.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC;
