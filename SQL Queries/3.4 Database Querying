Basic Queries in SQL

#1. You realize that only the “film_id” and “title” columns are needed. Write a new query that selects only those 2 columns.

SELECT film_id, title FROM film

#2. Select every film from the “film” table, with the movies sorted by title from A to Z, then by most recent release year, and then by highest to lowest rental rate.

SELECT title, release_year, rental_rate FROM film
ORDER by title ASC, release_year DESC, rental_rate DESC

#3. What is the average rental rate for each rating category?

SELECT rating, AVG(rental_rate) FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY AVG(rental_rate) DESC

#4. What are the minimum and maximum rental durations for each rating category?

SELECT rating, MAX(rental_rate) FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY MAX(rental_rate) DESC

SELECT rating, MIN(rental_rate) FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY MIN(rental_rate) DESC

#5. What are the minimum replacement costs for each rating category ordered by rating as follows: G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17?

SELECT rating, MIN(replacement_cost)
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY CASE
WHEN rating = 'G' THEN 1
WHEN rating = 'PG' THEN 2
WHEN rating = 'PG-13' THEN 3
WHEN rating = 'R' THEN 4
WHEN rating = 'NC-17' THEN 5
ELSE 6
END;
