# Rockbuster_SQL
I analysed data from fictional movie rental business Rockbuster. This repository contains my Queries, Results and the Notes I made on my queries

## I was tasked with discovering
<ul><li>Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?</li></ul>
<ul><li>What was the average rental duration for all videos?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Which countries are Rockbuster customers based i n?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?</li></ul>

### The data source can be found here:

## Folder structure
There are three folders in this repository
<ol><li>1. SQL Queries - the questions I was tasked with and the queries I used to answer them -</li></ol>
<ol><li>2. Notes and Outouts on Queries - a full record of how I arrived at the correct query, motes, method, and missteps to avoid -</li></ol>
<ol><li>3. Data Outputs from pgAdmin - .csv and .xls files containing the results of my Queries</li></ol>
